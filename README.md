**To Do**:
   - "refresh" sub-command executable by console to manually regenerate the leaderboard
   - another argument for the "reset" sub-command to reset only a specified player
   - "test" sub-command, another way to test CPS by leftclicking on an item in a GUI

If you'd like to contribute to something flagged as "to do", submit a pull request and
I'll put you in the contributors and post a new resource update on GitHub releases, SpigotMC and SkUnity;

Also the implementation of other features, the submission of issues or feature requests
and any bug fixes or improvements are obviously welcome.
